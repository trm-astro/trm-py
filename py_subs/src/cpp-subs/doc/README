This documentation is not distributed as part of the autoconf stuff because
that would require people to have sphinx running amongst other things. The
idea is that the documentation will be on-line.

To create the documentation type the following:

make html

  -- builds local html docs. Check by pointing a browser at
     _build/html/index.html

make install-html

  -- copies them across to web server at Warwick


Note that 'conf.py' gets the version from the top-level configure.ac and so
you should not change the relative depth of the directory it lies in.

_store: directory where rst created from the source code by genrst.py are 
        stored.
