'lcurve' is for modelling of light curves.

Installation order: subs --> colly, binary --> roche --> lcurve

The file called 'Lcurve' that is generated in this directory defines
aliases (csh-style) and prints a help message when sourced.

Installation can be painful I'm afraid, but I don't have the time to make
a better job of it I am afraid. For details, please see:
