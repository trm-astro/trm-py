<h1>Binary star software home hage</h1>
<p>
The binary star software provides a small set of generally useful functions for binary stars
(circular orbits only I'm afraid). Thus it has functions for computing orbital periods
and separations, the angular momentum loss rate due to gravitational waves and a few
associated routines to do with stellar radii. There are no programs, only callable
functions. The software is written in C++.

See  the <a href="api/html/index.html">API docs</a> for detailed information upon the 
available functions.

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>
To install, download the <tr><td><a href="http://www.astro.soton.ac.uk/~trm/tar/trm-binary-1.0.tar.gz">gzipped tar file</a>
</td>,gunzip and tar xvf it. A new directory will be created. Change directory into it and read the README file. Get in touch
with me if you have problems.
